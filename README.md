## How to use?
There is one interface `Client` to use all the [printful API](https://www.theprintful.com/docs). First create a variable to keep your client,

``` java
Client printfulClient = new CompositeClient("YOUR API KEY");
```

`CompositeClient` uses multiple specific clients to serve full API, if you want to use a specific API, you can use a specific API client, for example,
``` java
Client printfulOrdersClient = new OrdersApiClient("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

> Do remember that `OrdersApiClient` will have all the methods available, but methods which are not related to [Orders API](https://www.theprintful.com/docs/orders) will throw a `NotImplementedException`.

This client uses HTTPS JSON API provided by Printful as documented [here](https://www.theprintful.com/docs). When using methods, please refer to that documentation. Javadocs are available with builds as well as [here](https://jitpack.io/com/github/clayfish/printful4j/f0095e50da/javadoc/).

> Currently many methods throw `NotImplementedException` because this client is in development stage. Please use caution while using this library.
